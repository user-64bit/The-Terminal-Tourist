Yo, welcome to new blog post where I don't know what i do and I just mess around with new things which seems pretty cool to me.
so in today's blog post we're going to deep dive into mind of memers(those fuckers are everywhere) and how this [pump.fun](https://pump.fun/board) works.

*Note: This is all about memes so if you're not comfortable with memes then you might not get some references.*

So just click on <a href="https://pump.fun" target="_blank">pump.fun</a>

Now as you might have already lost half of your eye sight because of those animations, you'll see some weird looking website.(website itself feel like meme 沽)

### So, What is pump.fun?

Pump.fun is a Solana-based platform that allows users to easily create and trade their own memecoins. It offers a user-friendly interface and low costs, making it accessible for both crypto enthusiasts and newcomers.

#### Now you might say, blah blah blah copied from the internet again 沽ｮ窶昨汳ｨ

Ok ok calm down, you know I always wanted to create a random coin like ******(*18+*) and I couldn't because
it is "little" lenghty process to create your coin and if it has some weird word people can hate you but now with pump.fun there are other psychos like you too,so no worries.

jokes aside. pump.fun is zerodha/binance(but bought from meesho) of *meme coins* and you can be creator of new **meme-coin** or you can trade existing coins(created by others) with ease. you can name your coin anything*.

![Meme Coin](/assets/What-the-hell-is-pump-dot-fun/meme-coin-idea.png)


So if you want to create your own coin with your crush's name, you can in literally less than 2 minutes(same time you last during...)

Now you might have basic understanding of what is pump.fun right? if not don't worry you'll understand, just continue reading.

### A Little History

Actually I shouldn't even use word "History" because pump.fun started on **January 2024**(Yes that's not typo)
and it has quickly gained popularity in the crypto community.

Picture this: It's January 2024. Everyone is talking about Crypto, and the [degens](https://crypto.com/glossary/degen#:~:text=Key%20Takeaway-,'Degen'%20is%20a%20slang%20term%20derived%20from%20the%20word%20',high%2Drisk%20and%20speculative%20trading.) are getting restless. Enter Pump.fun be like, "Hey, what if we made a platform where people could throw money at memes without getting completely wrecked?"
Initially, Pump.fun was all about that Solana life. Why? because why not?
Solana has lesser gas fees and it is much faster than ETH.

by April, the Pump.fun devs expanded to include Ethereum's Layer 2 networks, Base and Blast.
(*people who pays 50$ gas fees*)

Pump.fun was bootstrapped by Alliance DAO, a group of VCs who apparently looked at the dumpster fire that is memecoin trading and thought, "Yeah, let's throw some gasoline on that." And you know what? It worked. Pump.fun started printing money faster than your favorite Danny Daniels.

There are few reasons why people love pump.fun.\
-> user(memer)-friendly interface\
-> low fees\
-> Anti scam Measures\
-> Bonding Curve Model(keep reading for understanding this jargon)

### Why does it exist?

As I told you this Yug is called Kali Yug and we humans are stupid and we like stupid things(actually it's not stupid at all, it's fun, I just found out <a href="https://pump.fun/3A6a9ddBwLRrBP5nv92gVPYGDQJhDwc9BxkQrT3Hu6rj" target="_blank">Sol CEO Coin</a>, isn't it cute? sorry I just couldn't control 衍ｹ I'm human too)\
Also if you think this is stupid then you haven't heard about people who thinks *moon landing is fake* **and** *earth is flat*.

Ok lemme get back to point, so if some developer wants to create a crypto token, developer will be able to figure out things and will eventually manage to figure out some way to create it but what about regular humans?\
(*we also want regular humans to loose there money in crypto too. right?*)

汨 you can checkout <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=befUVytFC80" target="_blank">Creat you own crypto (The Developer way) [Optional]</a>

So developer or non-developer you can create your crypto token on pump.fun with just few clicks.(don't worry I'll explain how to in next section)

#### Now you might say, okay I got the basic idea about what pump.fun is, now I want to earn f***ing money so tell me how to create tokens fast.

Calm down Big boy.

***in English: Haste makes waste***

### How to Launch token and make 汳ｰ

If you just click on "How it works"(probably at top left corner) it will show you something like this,
![How it works](/assets/What-the-hell-is-pump-dot-fun/how-it-works.png)

now let's create our token. got to "Start a new coin" or click <a href="https://pump.fun/create" target="_blank">here</a> you lazy ass.\
and connect your wallet if you haven't 洟ｷ (it'll be probably on top right corner)\
and now fill the details of your token.
![Create big things](/assets/What-the-hell-is-pump-dot-fun/create-coin-page.png)  
*As I'm unemployed and broke, I can't click on that 沽*
You'll need to Pay a small fee of about **0.02 SOL** to deploy your token.\
(*small fee for people with job* 衍ｲ)

Now sit tight because I'll throw a lot of jargons.

After smashing the "Create coin" button you'll probably have this popup.
![Create big things](/assets/What-the-hell-is-pump-dot-fun/you-buy-token-page.png)
***Of course, you'll buy your own coin, right?***

So you might have multiple questions like,

=> Should I buy my token or not?洟能
=> What is the initial supply of the token?洟能
=> How much should I buy?洟能
=> What if I buy it all?洟能
=> Tell me fast, I want to click on the "Create coin" button.洟ｧ

calm down. you're freaking me out with these questions.
![Breathe in & Breathe out](/assets/What-the-hell-is-pump-dot-fun/iski-vehen-ka-masala-dosa.jpg)
***Breathe in & Breathe out***

Let me answer your questions one by one:

#### Q: Should I buy my token or not?

> => if you buy your token it will provide initial liquidity to the trading pool. If you don't do this, the token may start with very low or no liquidity.\
> => if you don't buy then other traders won't put their trust as they see that the creator hasn't invested in it themselves.\
> => Would you buy someone's token even if they've not invested on their own token? if yes then go fuck yourself.

#### Q: what is the initial supply of token?

> => It is around 800 millions(as you can see in above image it's 793+ millions)

#### Q: How much should i buy?

[Note: not financial advice]
> => It is really upto you how much you want to buy but it is said that buying some 6 SOL(don't trust me on this, i got this number from reddit) worth of token can help provide some initial liquidity and price stability.

#### Q: What if I buy all?

> => The whole game is of Demand and Supply. if you have all the supply then what's the demand. (*at least while launching the token*) if you've all the BTC then that might be different case as it will have high demand as you buy and price will go up but if people start loosing trust in BTC then people won't buy it and it's value will eventually decrease.\
> => so it would be better to buy some portion of supply and not all.Now I hope your all doubts are covered...

Then click on "Create Coin" focker.泅

### What's next with my token

Now you might think that, I've created the token and bought 20% of that for my self now what?

pump.fun follows "some" process which determined what next will happend to your token. now what's that process?\
The process is simple, when lots of people start buying your token price go up and when lots of people start selling the token price goes down.(it works same as zerodha or binance) now when your token reaches certain market
cap(i.e. 69k dollars) then pump.fun will automatically close trading on your token and it will move your token to **Raydium**. Now as your token has moves to **Raydium** so this process of moving your token from **pump.fun** to **Raydium** is called *filling the bonding curve*.

Now you might ask what the fuck is **Bonding curve** and what is **Raydium**?\
![You're Good Question...](https://media1.tenor.com/m/OYEn73oxJOsAAAAC/good-question-you-are-a-good-question-deepak-dobriyal.gif)

#### Q: What is Raydium?
Raydium is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) built on the Solana blockchain.(and this is enough information for understanding this blog post)

now don't tell me you don't know what is **DEX** or **AMM**, if you don't know what is **DEX** then go watch [*Silicon Valley*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/) and if you don't know what is
**AMM** then go read [this blog post](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/amm-what-are-automated-market-makers#section-liquidity-pools-and-liquidity-providers).

Now we're ok?\
#### Q: What is Bonding curve?
A bonding curve is a mathematical model that defines the relationship between the price of a token and its supply.

*Again copied from the internet blah blah*

if you're into mathematics then I'll link few blog post which will dive deep into matematics side because bonding curve iteself is big blog post, but for this blog post we'll make it easy for humans to understand.

A bonding curve is mathematical curve which defines relationship between price and suppy.A bonding curve is monotonic(Always increasing) and Deterministic(same input give same output).Bonding curves can be a primitive price discovery mechanism.

The price discovery process is the process of finding the price of an asset(token) in the marketplace through the interactions of buyers and sellers.

Just for example we take our bonding curve formula as, **currentPrice = tokenSupplyﾂｲ**
![Bonding curve Example chart](/assets/What-the-hell-is-pump-dot-fun/bonding-curve-example.jpg)

Above bonding curve indicates that, as the amount of tokens increases the prices will increase. so it
make exponential growth rate. so simple math will teach us that, at total supply of 10,000 tokens if prices is
100$ then if total supply increases to 100,000 then you'll have xxxxx$ (I don't know, your money you count it yourself)

But we're talking about pump.fun and which bonding curve it follows?
pump.fun follows **Step function bonding curve algorithm** and now what it is?

The step function bonding curve is a specific type of bonding curve characterized by **discrete price intervals**. Unlike **continuous curves**, where price changes smoothly, step function curves have distinct price points that remain constant within defined ranges.

in easy term there are multiple "bond stage" and when minted tokens changes with certain numbers,  "bond stage" changes which implies to change in price. in more easy term A function of token price and supply

Suppose as example,

=> Bond Step 1: 0-100 tokens = 0.01 ETH per token\
=> Bond Step 2: 101-200 tokens = 0.02 ETH per token\
=> Bond Step 3: 201-300 tokens = 0.03 ETH per token

So when number of minted tokens reaches to 101 then there will be a price jump from 0.01 ETH to 0.02 ETH.

Off topic but, [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/) follows **constant product formula**. which is continuous bonding curve, where prices changes smoothly. but what is difference between these two?

     | Feature                  | Constant Product Formula  | Step Function Bonding Curve               |
     | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------|
     | Pricing Model            | Continuous                | Discrete                                  |
     | Price Adjustment         | Smooth and gradula        | Sudden jumps at thresholds("bond stage")  |
     | Liquidity Management     | Always available          | May have gaps in liquidity                |
     | Market Behavior          | Predictable trading costs | Potentially volatile at transitions       |
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I hope You understand what is bonding curve and now if you're mathematician and you want to dive deep into
bonding curves then, check out references at the end of post.

There is one more jargon, i would like to explain which is "King of the Hill" aka KOTH I'm not talking about [this one](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118375/)

When token "X" reaches $30K market cap, the pump.fun will remove current KOTH and make token "X"
current King of The Hill. KOTH is featured spot which sometimes brings new buyers and push your token's 
popularity more.

***Bro is everywhere.***

### How does pump.fun makes money?

There are multiple ways pump.fun makes money. first one is when we're creating token we need to pay creation fees which is typically **0.02 SOL**. Also it takes around 1% fees on all transactions.when your token fill the bonding curve(means your token is moved to **Radiyum**) then pump.fun takes 2 SOL.

### Pros & Cons

Everything has there Pros and Cons and so do pump.fun too.

**Pros**

=> Easy Token Creation

=> Early Entry to other Tokens (one token can make you rich or poor)

=> Minimal Fees

=> No Technical knowledge required

**Cons**

=> High Volatility (As it uses Step function bonding curve mechanism)

=> Risk of Scams (and there are lots of scams) 

=> Raydium Dump (high chances of token will dump immediately upon reaching Raydium)

=> Market Manipulation Risk (bots are everywhere and they can be use to buy and sell token which could mislead genuine buyer)

**Common Scams**

=> pump and dump schemes: This classic scam involves increasing the price of a token through coordinated buying (the "pump") and then selling off holdings at the peak (the "dump"). Many tokens created on Pump.fun are subject to this manipulation, leading to significant losses for late investors. [Read Real Life Example](https://coingape.com/pump-fun-scam-dubai-investor-mints-30-million-in-crypto-celebrity-pump-and-dump/)

=> Rung pulls: In this type of scam creator of token raises money and then aband the project and leave investor crying for their money. so check before investing.

=> Big Buyer and Dump: In this Devs create illusion of showing people that their token is is being bought by other buyer to attract new investor. they just use different wallet addresses to buy and sell which will create illusion that people are interested in the token.
